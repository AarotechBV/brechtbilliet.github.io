For the people that are used to read my articles... This is not the type of articles I generally write.
Since I'm passionate about this subject, I'm going to write about it anyway. Bear with me, you might take away
something from it. And if not, at least you gave it a shot, right? I'm writing a book as we speak, not sure if I'll
ever publish it, but consider this a very slimmed down version of a chapter in that book. 

This article is about personal experiences in my life and career and can be bare, how I struggled with life and how I managed to break free. 
The reason I'm writing about this is that I think it might help people, sometimes the answer to a happy and fulfilling life is quite easy.

The people that know me, or at least followed me in the last 7 years, might have experienced a form of silence of me in the last years.
I used to blog more actively, used to be on conferences from time to time and in the frontend community my name occasionally
dropped by. That stopped for a while and I'll tell you why later. First let's go back to the start.

### The beginning of my career

In 2010 my boss told me my work sucked! Although he wasn't able to tell me why nor what I did wrong, he seemed to really enjoy telling me that.
I was a junior engineer (just left school), and I was the only one doing web development at that company. I did Ruby, PHP, java, C++, C, Vb.NET, javascript, photoshop and a
bunch of other things. Apparently a customer told him there was a bug in my code so of course I needed to be punished.
When he told me my work sucked, and he couldn't even tell me why I decided to quit my job on the spot.

This was one of my first encounters of **Breaking out of the comfort zone**. I felt like crap, and I had no idea what I needed to do, but for some reason this brought me luck.
I needed to find a job because I needed to pay my rent, I met interesting people that convinced me to do some consulting, and a few months later I was a .NET consultant working for a Belgian railways company.
Yes, I had to learn day and night to learn the technology, but it gave me a certain drive and I didn't experienced it as putting in effort.
Being in that company was super uncomfortable in the beginning but it grew on my quite fast and I was able to grow very quickly.

2 years later there was a small voice telling me it's better to fail trying then to rust up and so I decided to become selfemployed.
Since then every move I made in my career made me feel very uncomfortable in the beginning, but turned out to pay off!
I'm not going to go into every time a broke out of my comfort zone, I have my book for that. But this article is to wake people up.
Getting out of your comfort zone, will open up doors you wouldn't expect to.

A colleague of mine called Yannick asked me to give a talk for the company he worked for. He said it was for about 10 people. I was scared to do that but since it was only 10 people I decided
to do it. I created a talk about Angular.js components and unidirectional dataflows and I was ready to impress a dozen of people. 
It felt uncomfortable in the beginning, and I even felt more uncomfortable when those 10 people turned out to be 100 people (Thank Yannick! ;-)). 
Anyways, I was already there on stage and the talk went quite nice. **Breaking out of that comfort zone** resulted in a Belgian publishing company asked me to perform my first 3 day audit for their
angular.js code. The more I break out of that comfort zone, the luckier i got. Opportunities started to present themselves.

### Becoming an international Angular trainer/consultant

After that Yannick his company asked me to do a training in Angular2 (which was the successor of angular.js at the time), I decided to jump on the occasion.
That wasn't uncomfortable but organising a 2-day public workshop in a venue in Ghent weeks later certainly was... What if I wasn't going to sell those workshops?
I would totally fail then, right?! It was not cheap to rent the venue, and I would have had to admit my failure.

I had listened to a talk of [Todd Motto](https://www.twitter.com/toddmotto) a few weeks before that, where he explained **nothing was ever achieved in the comfort zone** and I decided to 
follow the dream and give my own public Angular workshop. 
Even people told me I couldn't, I not sold only one but three public 2-day workshops that month for 8 people per session.
At the same time there was a famous Angular training company giving a workshop (also in Ghent), but I didn't let that hold me back.

Getting out of my comfort zone again brought me luck and a year later I was freelancing for that same famous Angular company.

In one of those workshops I met [Jurgen Van de Moere](https://www.twitter.com/jvandemo) who later turned out to be [ng-be](https://ng-be.org/) co-organiser 
together with [Sam vloeberghs](https://twitter.com/samvloeberghs). 

Even though I didn't knew Jurgen was co-organiser of ng-be, I invited him to my workshop for free because I thought he was an interesting guy (and he is) and since he liked it
he asked me to give a training at ng-be. Getting out of your comfort zone brought me opportunities once more.
Years went by, I started a company together with [Kwinten Pisman](https://www.twitter.com/kwintenp) called StrongBrew and we became international trainers/consultants in frontend technologies like
Angular and RxJs.

### Getting back into my comfort zone

First of all, getting out of that comfort zone, and making big jumps in your career has some consequences. 
There is this thing called imposter syndrome where I will probably blog about later. There is the feeling that you are hitting a ceiling, that you need
to do more, be more, etc. It can be exhausting. I had a family that I wasn't giving enough attention at times, I was getting fatter and it was hard to find balance.

While we had 4 awesome years with StrongBrew, COVID-19 happened and Kwinten went to work for StackBlitz.
I settled working for one client and I started a small company on the side where I gave culinary workshops on ceramic grills.
That turned out to be quite successful and I was able to focus on that as an (read the quotes) "entrepreneur".
By choice, I divorced the mother of my children, only saw my 2 lovely children half of the time and I started to struggle with life.
I still had a decent income, worked for an awesome client called Rosa which I'm sure it will shape the landscape in health software.

I basically had everything. I was fit at the time, I was able to keep the house after the divorce, my children were healthy, I met a beautiful girlfriend with a great personality.
Everything was going well in my life and still I had hard time to find happiness.
Although I had to deal with feelings of guilt towards the mother of my children and my children as well (for leaving their mother)
 I basically had everything going for me.

I have had deep moments, dark moments, numb moments and like a cancer it sneaks up on you. You realise that you are unhappy,
unfulfilled, unmotivated and you are basically agreeing with life, or at least settling with life.

### Breaking out

At a bonfire a friend of my saw the misery in my eyes and asked me to look up Tony Robbins who was some kind of life
coach helping people to become better versions of themselves. Of course I was sceptical but at a bored Netflix evening
I looked him up and I haven't stopped looking/reading since then. He made me realise two things:
- That helping/coaching/mentoring people makes me happy
- That I needed to break out of my comfort zone once more to achieve it
