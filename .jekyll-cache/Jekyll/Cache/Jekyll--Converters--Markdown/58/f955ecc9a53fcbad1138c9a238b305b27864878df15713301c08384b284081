I"¨<p><a href="https://github.com/ngrx/platform/blob/master/docs/store/README.md">@ngrx/store</a> is a library that tries to solve the problems of state management through the principles of <a href="https://redux.js.org/">Redux</a>. The difference between Redux and @ngrx/store is that @ngrx/store is written specifically for <a href="https://angular.io">Angular</a> and it embraces the use of Observables from <a href="http://reactivex.io/rxjs/">RxJS</a>.
The combination of redux principles and RxJS can be very powerful when it comes to writing reactive applications.
Since a lot of Angular projects use @ngrx/store, it might be a good idea to write down some best-practices.</p>
